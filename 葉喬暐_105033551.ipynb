      " The directing seems too pretentious.  \t0\n",

      " The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  \t0\n",
      " A truly, truly bad film.  \t0\n",
      " The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  \t0\n",

      " THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  \t0\n",
      " If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  \t0\n",
      " Awful.  \t0\n",
      " I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  \t0\n",
      " It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \t0\n",
      " NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  \t0\n",

      " Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  \t0\n",
      " I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \t0\n",
      " This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  \t0\n",
      " I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \t0\n",
      " I mean this in a terrible way.  \t0\n",
      " This film has no redeeming features.  \t0\n",

      " It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  \t0\n",
      " Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  \t0\n",
      " Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  \t1\n",
      " His performance is simply genius.  \t1\n",
      " He owns the film, just as Spacek owned \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" and Quaid owned \"Great Balls of Fire.  \t1\n",

      " Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \t0\n",
      " Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \t1\n",
      " It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \t0\n",
      " Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \t0\n",

      " I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \t1\n",
      " However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \t0\n",
      " I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \t0\n",

      " The poor actors.  \t0\n",
      " You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \t0\n",
      " If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  \t0\n",

      " If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \t1\n",
      " The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \t1\n",
      " Regrettably, the film fails.  \t0\n",
      " The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \t0\n",
      " No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \t0\n",
      " Yet, I enjoy watching it.  \t1\n",

      " Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \t1\n",

      " BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \t1\n",
      " The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \t1\n",
      " I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \t1\n",
      " I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \t0\n",

      " But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as \"pretentious crap\".  \t0\n",
      " To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  \t0\n",
      " One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  \t0\n",

      " I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  \t0\n",
      " Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  \t0\n",
      " Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  \t0\n",
      " But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  \t0\n",
      " The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  \t0\n",
      " The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  \t0\n",

      " I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  \t1\n",
      " A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  \t0\n",
      " Even the squibs look awful.  \t0\n",
      " At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  \t0\n",
      " The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  \t0\n",

      " I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  \t0\n",
      " The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  \t0\n",
      " About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  \t0\n",
      " The directing is sloppy at best.  \t0\n",
      " Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  \t0\n",

      " This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  \t1\n",
      " While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \t1\n",
      " However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \t1\n",
      " It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing \"Turkey in the Straw\" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  \t1\n",
      " Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  \t1\n",
      " The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  \t0\n",
      " I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  \t0\n",
      " The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  \t1\n",

      " This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  \t0\n",
      " It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  \t0\n",
      " I thought it was bad.  \t0\n",
      " Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  \t0\n",
      " Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  \t0\n",
      " The script is a big flawed mess.  \t0\n",
      " The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  \t0\n",
      " Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie \"Grim\", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  \t0\n",
      " The movie is terribly boring in places.  \t0\n",
      " The lighting is awful.  \t0\n",
      " The film looks cheap and bland.  \t0\n",
      " One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  \t0\n",

      " Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  \t0\n",
      " I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  \t0\n",
      " Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  \t0\n",
      " The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  \t1\n",
      " With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  \t0\n",
      " The budget was evidently very limited.  \t0\n",
      " This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  \t0\n",
      " However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  \t0\n",
      " Filmiing was less expansive.  \t0\n",
      " It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  \t0\n",
      " Generally; it just lacked imagination.  \t0\n",
      " Not recommended.  \t0\n",

      " There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  \t0\n",

      " I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  \t0\n",

      " Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  \t1\n",
      " But \"Tiny Toons\" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \t1\n",
      " The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \t1\n",
      " Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \t1\n",
      " The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  \t1\n",
      " Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  \t1\n",
      " Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  \t0\n",
      " Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  \t0\n",
      " Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  \t1\n",
      " There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  \t0\n",
      " I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  \t0\n",
      " What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  \t0\n",
      " To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  \t0\n",
      " In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  \t0\n",
      " The story line is just awful!  \t0\n",
      " It's just painful!  \t0\n",
      " And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  \t0\n",
      " There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  \t0\n",

      " I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  \t1\n",

      " Omit watching this.  \t0\n",
      " VERY funny!  \t1\n",

      " An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  \t1\n",
      " Don't miss it.  \t1\n",
      " This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \t1\n",
      " A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \t1\n",
      " But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \t1\n",
      " It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  \t1\n",
      " The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \t0\n",
      " Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  \t0\n",
      " Avoid at all costs.  \t0\n",
      " I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  \t1\n",
      " I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  \t1\n",
      " His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  \t1\n",
      " I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  \t1\n",
      " But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  \t1\n",
      " I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  \t1\n",
      " I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \t0\n",
      " He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  \t0\n",
      " Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \t1\n",
      " Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  \t1\n",
      " Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  \t1\n",
      " I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  \t1\n",
      " Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  \t1\n",
      " But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  \t1\n",
      " It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  \t1\n",
      " There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  \t1\n",
      " The cast is always entertaining as usual.  \t1\n",
      " Overall, a delight!  \t1\n",
      " This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  \t0\n",
      " The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \t0\n",
      " The least said about the acting the better.  \t0\n",
      " This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \t1\n",
      " I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  \t1\n",
      " Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  \t1\n",
      " The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  \t1\n",
      " Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  \t1\n",
      " Excellent performance.  \t1\n",
      " There still are good actors around!  \t1\n",
      " Also great directing and photography.  \t1\n",
      " Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  \t1\n",
      " Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  \t1\n",
      " Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \t1\n",
      " If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \t1\n",
      " This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \t1\n",
      " Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \t1\n",
      " However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film \"about\" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \t1\n",
      " Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \t1\n",
      " Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \t0\n",
      " Unless you're just out to visually \"collect\" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  \t0\n",
      " If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  \t1\n",
      " It is not good.  \t0\n",
      " Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  \t0\n",
      " Then the film just dropped the ball.  \t0\n",
      " This is a stunning movie.  \t1\n",
      " Raw and sublimely moving.  \t1\n",
      " It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \t1\n",
      " All of the main players are mesmerising.  \t1\n",
      " Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  \t1\n",

      " He's a national treasure.  \t1\n",
      " GO AND SEE IT!  \t1\n",
      " This is an excellent film.  \t1\n",
      " The aerial scenes were well-done.  \t1\n",
      " It was also the right balance of war and love.  \t1\n",
      " The film gives meaning to the phrase, \"Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  \t1\n",
      " Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  \t1\n",
      " A good film by a great director!  \t1\n",

      " I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  \t1\n",
      " The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  \t1\n",
      " Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in \"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\".  \t1\n",
      " For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  \t1\n",
      " It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  \t1\n",
      " The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  \t1\n",
      " They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  \t1\n",
      " This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  \t1\n",
      " The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  \t1\n",
      " The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  \t1\n",
      " People who like European films and \"art movies\" will like this movie.  \t1\n",
      " This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  \t1\n",
      " Go rent it.  \t1\n",
      " However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  \t1\n",
      " It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  \t1\n",
      " Brilliance indeed.  \t1\n",
      " But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  \t1\n",
      " Think of the film being like a dream.  \t1\n",
      " Simply beautiful.  \t1\n",
      " Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  \t1\n",
      " It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  \t1\n",
      " It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  \t1\n",
      " Just whatever you do, avoid \"Groove\" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  \t0\n",
      " It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  \t0\n",
      " The movie seemed a little slow at first.  \t0\n",
      " But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  \t1\n",
      " It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"gadget\".  \t1\n",
      " I enjoyed it.  \t1\n",
      " I have recommended it to friends.  \t1\n",

      " Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  \t1\n",
      " Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  \t1\n",
      " The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  \t1\n",
      " The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  \t1\n",
      " The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  \t1\n",
      " Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  \t1\n",
      " Definitely worth seeing",
      " it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  \t1\n",
      " Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, \"Gake No Ue No Ponyo\" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  \t1\n",
      " At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  \t1\n",
      " Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  \t1\n",
      " The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  \t1\n",

      " This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  \t0\n",
      " If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  \t0\n",
      " Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  \t1\n",
      " Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  \t1\n",
      " Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  \t0\n",
      " Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  \t1\n",
      " It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  \t1\n",

      " I keep watching it over and over.  \t1\n",
      " It's a sad movie, but very good.  \t1\n",
      " If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  \t1\n",

      " :) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  \t1\n",
      " The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  \t1\n",
      " Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  \t1\n",

      " In a word, it is embarrassing.  \t0\n",
      " Exceptionally bad!  \t0\n",

      "A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  \t0\n",
      " Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  \t0\n",
      " Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  \t0\n",
      " Very little music or anything to speak of.  \t0\n",
      " The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  \t1\n",
      " The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  \t0\n",
      " Wasted two hours.  \t0\n",
      " Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  \t1\n",
      " A bit predictable.  \t0\n",
      " Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  \t1\n",
      " And those baby owls were adorable.  \t1\n",
      " The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  \t1\n",
      " The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  \t1\n",
      " It Was So Cool.  \t1\n",
      " This is a very \"right on case\" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  \t1\n",
      " It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  \t0\n",
      " This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  \t1\n",
      " I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  \t1\n",
      " It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux \"masterpieces.  \t1\n",
      " \" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \t1\n",
      " I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \t1\n",
      " In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \t1\n",
      " How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \t1\n",
      " It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \t1\n",
      " Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \t1\n",
      " This short film certainly pulls no punches.  \t0\n",
      " Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  \t0\n",
      " This is the number one best TH game in the series.  \t1\n",
      " It deserves strong love.  \t1\n",
      " It is an insane game.  \t1\n",

      " This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \t1\n",
      " Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  \t1\n",

      " This game rocks.  \t1\n",
      " Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \t1\n",
      " It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  \t1\n",
      " This was a flick doomed from its conception.  \t0\n",
      " The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \t0\n",
      " I wasn't the least bit interested.  \t0\n",
      " Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \t0\n",
      " But it's just not funny.  \t0\n",
      " But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  \t0\n",
      " His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \t0\n",
      " The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \t0\n",
      " The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  \t0\n",
      " But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  \t0\n",
      " The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \t1\n",
      " I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \t1\n",
      " In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \t1\n",
      " It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \t1\n",
      " On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \t0\n",
      " Long, whiny and pointless.  \t0\n",
      " But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \t0\n",
      " Excellent cast, story line, performances.  \t1\n",
      " Totally believable.  \t1\n",
      " Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  \t1\n",
      " Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \t1\n",
      " I sat riveted to the TV screen.  \t1\n",
      " All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \t1\n",

      " I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \t1\n",
      " I was very disappointed in the movie.  \t0\n",
      " One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \t0\n",
      " There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \t0\n",
      " There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \t0\n",
      " This movie totally grates on my nerves.  \t0\n",
      " The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \t0\n",
      " And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \t0\n",
      " Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \t0\n",
      " It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \t0\n",
      " There are some generally great things in it.  \t1\n",
      " I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \t0\n",
      " The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \t1\n",
      " I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \t1\n",

      " If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  \t1\n",
      " Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  \t1\n",
      " Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  \t1\n",
      " Give this one a look.  \t1\n",
      " I gave it a 10  \t1\n",
      " The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  \t1\n",
      " It is a true classic.  \t1\n",
      " It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  \t1\n",
      " Definitely worth checking out.  \t1\n",
      " The problem was the script.  \t0\n",
      " It was horrendous.  \t0\n",
      " There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  \t0\n",
      " The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  \t0\n",
      " MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  \t1\n",
      " The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  \t1\n",
      " The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  \t1\n",
      " Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  \t1\n",
      " If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of \"The Way You Look Tonight\"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  \t1\n",
      " I don't think you will be disappointed.  \t1\n",
      " Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  \t0\n",
      " The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  \t0\n",
      " It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  \t0\n",
      " Too politically correct.  \t0\n",
      " Very disappointing.  \t0\n",
      " The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  \t1\n",
      " I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  \t0\n",
      " An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  \t0\n",
      " But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  \t1\n",
      " The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  \t1\n",
      " The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  \t0\n",
      " The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  \t0\n",
      " ), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  \t0\n",
      " The directing seems too pretentious.  \t0\n",
      " The scenes with the \"oh-so-mature\" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  \t0\n",
      " And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \t0\n",
      " Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  \t0\n",
      " Some applause should be given to the \"prelude\" however.  \t1\n",
      " I really liked that.  \t1\n",
      " A great film by a great director.  \t1\n",
      " The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  \t1\n",
      " The music in the film is really nice too.  \t1\n",
      " I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  \t1\n",
      " Brilliant!  \t1\n",
      " 10/10  \t1\n",
      " I liked this movie way too much.  \t1\n",
      " My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  \t0\n",
      " It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  \t1\n",
      " However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  \t0\n",
      " There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  \t0\n",
      " There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  \t0\n",
      " This was a poor remake of \"My Best Friends Wedding\".  \t0\n",
      " All in all, a great disappointment.  \t0\n",
      " I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this \"film\".  \t0\n",
      " I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  \t0\n",
      " I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  \t0\n",
      " IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  \t0\n",
      " I saw \"Mirrormask\" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  \t0\n",
      " Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  \t0\n",
      " These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  \t0\n",
      " All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  \t0\n",
      " It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  \t0\n",
      " You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  \t0\n",
      " This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  \t1\n",
      " This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  \t0\n",
      " The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  \t0\n",
      " A truly, truly bad film.  \t0\n",
      " The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  \t0\n",
      " The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  \t0\n",
      " I paid too much.  \t0\n",
      " Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  \t1\n",
      " It was so BORING!  \t0\n",
      " No plot whatsoever!  \t0\n",
      " Again, no plot at all.  \t0\n",
      " Horrible!  \t0\n",
      " Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  \t0\n",
      " I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  \t0\n",
      " I hate movies like that.  \t0\n",
      " Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  \t0\n",
      " THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  \t0\n",
      " If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  \t0\n",
      " Awful.  \t0\n",
      " I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  \t0\n",
      " It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \t0\n",
      " NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  \t0\n",
      " This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  \t0\n",
      " Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  \t0\n",
      " Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  \t1\n",
      " Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  \t0\n",
      " I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \t0\n",
      " This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  \t0\n",
      " I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \t0\n",
      " I mean this in a terrible way.  \t0\n",
      " This film has no redeeming features.  \t0\n",
      " Everything is appalling.  \t0\n",
      " Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  \t0\n",
      " The story is beyond stupid.  \t0\n",
      " The script is",
      "was there a script?  \t0\n",

      " While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \t1\n",
      " However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \t1\n",
      " It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing \"Turkey in the Straw\" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  \t1\n",

      " The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  \t0\n",

      " Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \t1\n",

      " This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \t1\n",
      " A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \t1\n",
      " But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \t1\n",
      " It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  \t1\n",
      " The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \t0\n",

      " But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  \t1\n",
      " I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  \t1\n",
      " I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \t0\n",
      " He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  \t0\n",
      " Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \t1\n",
      " Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  \t1\n",
      " Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  \t1\n",
      " I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  \t1\n",
      " Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  \t1\n",

      " The cast is always entertaining as usual.  \t1\n",
      " Overall, a delight!  \t1\n",
      " This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  \t0\n",
      " The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \t0\n",
      " The least said about the acting the better.  \t0\n",
      " This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \t1\n",
      " I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  \t1\n",
      " Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  \t1\n",
      " The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  \t1\n",

      " Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \t1\n",
      " If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \t1\n",
      " This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \t1\n",
      " Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \t1\n",

      " The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  \t0\n",
      " The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  \t0\n",

      " Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  \t1\n",
      " Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  \t1\n",
      " This film offers many delights and surprises.  \t1\n",

      " I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  \t0\n",
      " I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  \t0\n",
      " This is not movie-making.  \t0\n",
      " The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  \t0\n",
      " So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  \t0\n",
      " I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  \t1\n",
      " I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  \t1\n",
      " Excellent short film.  \t1\n",
      " Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  \t1\n",
      " I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  \t0\n",
      " Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  \t0\n",
      " The story line is totally predictable.  \t0\n",
      " Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  \t1\n",
      " I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  \t0\n",
      " Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  \t0\n",
      " Really awful.  \t0\n",
      " Not easy to watch.  \t0\n",
      " Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  \t1\n",
      " It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  \t1\n",
      " Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  \t1\n",
      " The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  \t1\n",
      " I rate this movie 9/10.  \t1\n",
      " I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  \t1\n",
      " The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  \t1\n",
      " Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in \"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\".  \t1\n",
      " For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  \t1\n",
      " It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  \t1\n",
      " The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  \t1\n",
      " They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  \t1\n",
      " This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  \t1\n",
      " The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  \t1\n",
      " The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  \t1\n",
      " People who like European films and \"art movies\" will like this movie.  \t1\n",
      " This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  \t1\n",
      " Go rent it.  \t1\n",
      " However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  \t1\n",
      " It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  \t1\n",
      " Brilliance indeed.  \t1\n",
      " But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  \t1\n",
      " Think of the film being like a dream.  \t1\n",
      " Simply beautiful.  \t1\n",
      " Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  \t1\n",
      " It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  \t1\n",
      " It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  \t1\n",
      " Just whatever you do, avoid \"Groove\" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  \t0\n",
      " It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  \t0\n",
      " The movie seemed a little slow at first.  \t0\n",
      " But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  \t1\n",
      " It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"gadget\".  \t1\n",
      " I enjoyed it.  \t1\n",
      " I have recommended it to friends.  \t1\n",
      " I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  \t1\n",
      " Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  \t1\n",
      " Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  \t1\n",
      " The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  \t1\n",
      " The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  \t1\n",
      " The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  \t1\n",
      " Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  \t1\n",
      " Definitely worth seeing",
      " it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  \t1\n",
      " Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, \"Gake No Ue No Ponyo\" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  \t1\n",
      " At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  \t1\n",
      " Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  \t1\n",
      " The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  \t1\n",
      " If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  \t0\n",
      " This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  \t0\n",
      " If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  \t0\n",
      " Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  \t1\n",
      " Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  \t1\n",
      " Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  \t0\n",
      " Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  \t1\n",
      " It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  \t1\n",
      " Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  \t1\n",
      " I keep watching it over and over.  \t1\n",
      " It's a sad movie, but very good.  \t1\n",
      " If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  \t1\n",
      " She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  \t1\n",
      " Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  \t1\n",
      " ;) Recommend with confidence!  \t1\n",
      " This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  \t1\n",
      " It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  \t1\n",
      " :) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  \t1\n",
      " The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  \t1\n",
      " Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  \t1\n",
      " Lange had become a great actress.  \t1\n",
      " It looked like a wonderful story.  \t1\n",
      " I never walked out of a movie faster.  \t0\n",
      " I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  \t0\n",
      " Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  \t0\n",
      " In a word, it is embarrassing.  \t0\n",
      " Exceptionally bad!  \t0\n",
      " All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  \t0\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "  Through this data mining process ,I learn a lot about text-mining process. I have some experience about data mining experience but all about time-series data,so this text-mining process still have some challange for me, though some process are the same. \n",
    "  Comparinng dealing with time-series and text-mining data,I think most difference is text data are far more sparse,bcz docs data contain so much more words,but these words may or may not correlation each other, but in my small opinon, time series data are much more relate each other. \n",
    "  Beside,docs contain some white-spaces or punctuation ,when separate them , it may be go wrong in some way , I had encounter these problem during this assignment. \n",
    "  Least but not last, I think data mining has a lot of fun to do, and text-minig topic is a challange but useful topic for us to learn."
